You are inspecting the repository for oversized source files. Run the following zsh command from the repo root to list files over 300 lines, then prioritize refactoring them into smaller, well-scoped modules. Be sure to skip generated output (e.g., build artifacts, autogenerated API clients, migration snapshots, or codegen directories) when deciding what to refactor.

```
git ls-files -coz --exclude-standard -- '*.js' '*.jsx' '*.ts' '*.tsx' '*.mjs' | while IFS= read -r -d '' file; do lines=$(wc -l < "$file"); if [ $lines -gt 300 ]; then echo "$lines $file"; fi; done | sort -nr
```

While planning refactors, pay close attention to the architectural guidance in `AGENTS.md` lines 59-62:

- Group features by domain inside `/app` and `/components`.
- Keep each component or module focused on a single responsibility, splitting files that creep past 300 lines.
- Separate concerns between UI, state management, data fetching, and business logic.
- Favor reuse of existing utilities, hooks, and components rather than duplicating logic.
