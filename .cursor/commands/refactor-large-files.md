You are inspecting the repository for oversized source files. Run the following zsh command from the repo root to list files over 300 lines, then prioritize refactoring them into smaller, well-scoped modules. Be sure to skip generated output (e.g., build artifacts, autogenerated API clients, migration snapshots, or codegen directories) when deciding what to refactor.

```
git ls-files -coz --exclude-standard -- '*.js' '*.jsx' '*.ts' '*.tsx' '*.mjs' | while IFS= read -r -d '' file; do lines=$(wc -l < "$file"); if [ $lines -gt 300 ]; then echo "$lines $file"; fi; done | sort -nr
```

While planning refactors, pay close attention to the architectural guidance in `AGENTS.md`:

- **Modular Architecture:** Group features by domain inside `/app` and `/components`. Shared utilities live under `/lib`.
- **Single Responsibility Principle:** As files approach 300 lines, consider splitting by responsibility. Each component, function, or module should have one clear purpose.
- **Separation of Concerns:** Distinguish between UI, state management, data fetching, and business logic layers.
- **DRY Principle:** Reuse code via shared utilities, hooks, and components. Abstract common patterns when they appear in 3+ places.

ENSURE THAT FUNCTIONALITY IS NOT BROKEN BY THE REFACOTRING PROCESS.
