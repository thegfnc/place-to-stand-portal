## **2\. Problem Statement**

* **Internal Inefficiency:** Team members waste significant time switching between apps to find client communications, track task progress, and verify billing statuses.  
* **Lack of Client Transparency:** Clients lack a real-time, self-service view into project progress, hour burn-down, and invoice history, leading to frequent status requests and potential misunderstandings.  
* **Siloed Knowledge:** Valuable insights from emails, meeting transcripts, and internal notes are difficult to search and are not centrally accessible, hindering effective collaboration and decision-making.

## **3\. MVP Goals & Objectives**

The primary goal of the MVP is to validate the core value proposition of a unified system by delivering a functional platform that solves the most pressing issues for our primary user groups.

* **Objective 1: Increase Operational Efficiency:** Reduce the time internal teams spend searching for project-related information by at least 30%.  
* **Objective 2: Enhance Client Transparency & Self-Service:** Decrease the volume of client status update requests by 50% by providing a self-service portal.  
* **Objective 3: Establish a Single Source of Truth:** Centralize 100% of project tasks, billing history, and meeting summaries for all active clients in the new system.
